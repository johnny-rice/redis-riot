[[_faq_logs_cutoff]]
Logs are cut off or missing::
This could be due to concurrency issues in the terminal when refreshing the progress bar and displaying logs.
Try running with job option `--progress log`.

[[_faq_unknown_options]]
Unknown options: '--keyspace', '--key'::
You must specify one or more Redis commands with import commands (<<_file_import,`file-import`>>, <<_datagen_faker,`faker`>>, <<_db_import,`db-import`>>).

[[_faq_dump_version]]
ERR DUMP payload version or checksum are wrong::
Redis 7 DUMP format is not backwards compatible with previous versions.
To replicate between different Redis versions, use <<_replication_type_struct,Type-Based Replication>>.

[[_faq_replication_timeout]]
Process gets stuck during replication and eventually times out::
This could be due to big keys clogging the replication pipes.
In these cases it might be hard to catch the offending key(s).
Try running the same command with `--info` and `--progress log` so that all errors are reported.
Check the database with `redis-cli` {link_redis_bigkeys} and/or use reader options to filter these keys out.

[[_faq_noauth]]
NOAUTH Authentication required::
This issue occurs when you fail to supply the `--pass <password>` parameter.

[[_faq_stream_id]]
ERR The ID argument cannot be a complete ID because xadd-id-uniqueness-mode is strict::
This usually happens in Active/Active (CRDB) setups where stream message IDs cannot be copied over to the target database.
Use the `--no-stream-id` option to disable ID propagation.

[[_faq_script]]
ERR Error running script... This Redis command is not allowed from scripts::
This can happen with Active/Active (CRDB) databases because the `MEMORY USAGE` command is not allowed to be run from a LUA script.
Use the `--mem-limit -1` option to disable memory usage.

[[_faq_outofmemory]]
java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space::
The JVM running RIOT ran out of memory.
Either increase max JVM heap size (`export JAVA_OPTS="-Xmx8g"`) or reduce RIOT memory usage by lowering `threads`, `batch`, `read-batch` and `read-queue`.
